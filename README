opennms Dashboard Readme
===============================================

This is based heavily on the excellent nagios dashboard found here:
http://dingleberry.me/2009/11/nagios-operations-dashboard/

Assuming you have the standard tutorial setup of opennms on ubuntu:

Installation: 
1) Install apache2, libapache2-mod-php, php5-curl 
2) Clone repo to /var/www
3) Disable security for REST GET's (temporary until I do some more work)
4) Browse to http://yourhost/opennms-dashboard/
